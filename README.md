# Repository Pattern with Unit Of Work
The Repository Pattern represents a collection of objects or entities of a specific type. It acts as an interface between the application code and the database. Instead of directly interacting with the database, the application interacts with the repository, which handles all the necessary database operations like querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.

 Repository Pattern with Unit of Work provides a structured approach to handle data access in an application. It improves code organization, reusability, testability, and flexibility. By using this pattern, we can create more maintainable and scalable applications.
